# CocoaWithLovePlaygrounds

Swift Playground versions of select articles from Cocoa with Love.

1. [Statements, messages, reducers](#statements-messages-reducers)
2. [CwlLayout: a declarative wrapper around Auto Layout](#cwllayout-a-declarative-wrapper-around-auto-layout)

## Statements, messages, reducers

This article originally appeared on the [Cocoa with Love](https://www.cocoawithlove.com) website: [Statements, messages and reducers](https://www.cocoawithlove.com/blog/statements-messages-reducers.html).

It should work in Xcode 8.3.3 and Xcode 9 (although the "Reducer" diagram image does not display in Xcode 9 beta 1).

Note that the playground may take about 10 seconds to start while it compiles the associated "Sources" for the project.
